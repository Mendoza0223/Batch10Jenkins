1. why don't we use out local/personal laptops/computers to host websites and testing frameworks.

1) I have to keep my laptop up and running all the time.
2) Personal laptops/computers don't have enough RAM CPU power to entertain huge requests
3) Internet connections are not that good
4) Security is also a very  big problem when it comes to host services on local machine for these reasons
5) Everyone can easily access them through their personal laptops
==========================================================================================
SDLC:
1) BAs discuss the requirements with clients and develop the SRS(Software requirement specification) documents
2) this document is then shared with Architects and QA team leads.
3) Architects design the software requirement document (SRD) and QA leads start planning the testing.
4) Once the SRDs are ready the developers start working (coding) and start building the application
5)This is where the deployment life cycle starts
       1) Once the application is developed on local/personal computersthey ask other developers or architects to review their
         code for any type of mistake and after they push the code to
         the git or any other version control system once it is done
         they request the dev ops or IT teams are deployed to development server(DEV) so that they are sure
          application still works outside their laptops.
          2) QA will request Dev ops IT team to deploy it to QA server.
          3) If everything looks good all the test cases are passed QAs will deploy it to staging server
          staging server they are replica of production servers so that we can test the application in as
          possible and same environment as production.
          4)if test cases fail QA will report them to Developer and whole cycle starts again
